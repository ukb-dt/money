> *Put but money in thy purse!*        
> -- Iago

We’re quoting Iago’s crooked gospel—but with better intentions, I hope. Let’s give that phrase its due and build your **speculator’s calculus** table: how *variance* turns into *value*, and how the gradient of desire becomes capital flow.

Here’s the tidy version, stripped to its bones and ready for your ledger:

| Ontological Phase | Physical Analogue    | Economic Analogue                   | Differential Form | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variance (θ′)** | Entropy / Noise      | **Uncertainty / Market Volatility** | (x, y)            | The fog of possibility—prices jitter, narratives diverge. A speculator *listens* here.   |
| **[Signal](https://ukb-dt.github.io/wl/) (θ)**    | Pattern / Field      | **Information / Trend Detection**   | y = f(x) + ε      | Structure emerges from noise. The trader starts modeling expectations.                   |
| **Gradient (Σ)**  | dy/dx — Slope        | **Arbitrage / Opportunity**         | ∂Price/∂Time      | The difference that does work—momentum, spread, edge. The speculator moves.              |
| **[Power](https://ukb-dt.github.io/nvidia-openai/) (h(t))**  | dE/dt — Work Rate    | **Cashflow / Leverage**             | ∂Wealth/∂t        | Flow of capital through time. The capitalist amplifies gradients into sustained returns. |
| **Energy (ΔS)**   | ∫ P dt — Stored Work | **Wealth / Equity / Value Ledger**  | Integral of Power | The crystallized outcome—balance sheet, property, yield. The game’s cumulative meaning.  |

So:
**Variance becomes Signal → Gradient becomes Power → Power integrates into Energy (Value).**

In Shakespearean shorthand:
*Put money in thy purse* means **store gradients as energy**—accumulate the work of time into a durable ledger.

In Ukubona canon, that’s the movement from **θ′ → θ → Σ → h(t) → ΔS**—from the entropy of markets to the thermodynamic peace of wealth.

The fun, of course, is realizing that speculation is just applied thermodynamics:
you’re measuring heat and turning it into light.
